# Numerical-Python-Book
Personal files created while learning with the book Numerical Python.

Most of the files are the same or almost exactly as the code showed on the book, which I write as reading each chapter in a way to practice the content while learning. If you are more interested in a nice organized code, you should check the official public github repo of the book, available here: https://github.com/Apress/numerical-python-second-ed
